dotfiles
-----

These are my dotfiles. There are many like them, but these ones are mine.

Clone it into `~` then `bash ~/dotfiles/install.sh`.

I reserve the right to break this at any time without any prior warning (and I expect to), but if you really want to use code from here it's licensed under the MIT license (terms in LICENSE.txt)
